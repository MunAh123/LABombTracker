The UI is simple it tells you whos turn it is to throw dark bomb. The app pretty much requires you to have a second monitor where you would position this. 
The UI displays the next player to throw the bomb and clicking next will trigger the 20 second timer as well. After 20 seconds has passed the UI will turn blue. This won't really be needed for people who are use to finding dark in the bosses buff window.
It initially assumes all 8 players have darks and you can press caps lock key to go to the next person. These can be changed in the settings tab to be any other key but personally caps lock was easiest.

This is what my second monitor looked like. Download the application from release and click the executable.
