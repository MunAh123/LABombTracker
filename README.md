The UI is simple it tells you whos turn it is to throw dark bomb. The app pretty much requires you to have a second monitor where you would position this. It initially assumes all 8 players have darks and you can press caps lock key to go to the next person. These can be changed in the settings tab to be any other key but personally caps lock was easiest.
